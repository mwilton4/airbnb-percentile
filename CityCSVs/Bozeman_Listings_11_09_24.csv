My name is Reno Walsh. I am the owner of Bozeman Montana Vacation Rentals. 

I sincerely appreciate Bozeman, Montana. I moved here in 1995 and immediately launched a career in the tourism industry. I met my wife to be on the summit of Saddle Peak in the Bridger Mountain Range just outside of town and a few years later I proposed to her in a raft on Montana’s Smith River. We were married downtown Bozeman at Lindley Park. Today we are the proud parents of two living in our own home on Bozeman’s northeast side. I’m an active volunteer and leader in the community. I’m the owner of a successful short-term rental and long-term downtown Bozeman vacation rental on North Montana Ave.

Bozeman Montana Vacation Rentals understands the importance of excellent customer service. I’ve guided thousands of guests around the world on active vacations. I’ve hosted thousands at food, wine, and beer conferences around the world. And, we have hosted over a thousand guests at our vacation rentals. Guests trust us and consistently rate their experience at the highest level.

My name is Cooper and I grew up in the lowcountry of South Carolina. I developed a love for the outdoors at a very young age and enjoy hiking, mountain biking, and anything on the water. 

I work remote for a software company you have probably used before and love the flexibility it gives me in terms of work locations / home offices. I have been to 32+ countries and want to keep adding to my list. What is your favorite country? 

When I travel I prefer to stay for longer visits to spread my roots into the local communities. 28+ day stays are my speciality so all of my units are equipped for mid term stays. Think standup desks, fast wifi, everything you need to cook, and welcoming spaces.

Making sure you have a smooth check in and the ability to ask any questions during your stay is my #1 priority.

We are originally from Connecticut and have lots of family there that we visit regularly. I’ve been back in Bozeman full time for about 8 years and love all the many activities MT has to offer including skiing, snow shoeing, hiking, cycling, camping, tennis, pickleball, yoga  and so much more. 

I have two sons, one who graduated from the US Naval Academy Annapolis and is now a Marine Officer stationed at Camp Lejeune in North Carolina. The other graduated from University College London, England Medical School and is currently working as a doctor in London and is a competitive rower. 

I’m busy managing my rental properties located on the edge of the MSU campus and our lovely Yellow Dogs guest Cottage along with working as a Property Manager for others. 

Our Yellow Dogs are named Rumo & Tater.  You will occasionally see them playing and chasing balls in the fenced in backyard.
